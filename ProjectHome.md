Nutrimatic is in the tradition of "dictionary grep" tools like tea, onelook, and good old "grep ... /user/dict/words".  Instead of using a fixed dictionary of words, it uses a large data file of words and phrases mined from Wikipedia text.  The results will be presented with the most common and likely words and phrases first.  Nutrimatic will also splice together existing words and phrases (with an appropriate penalty) to match the search pattern.
